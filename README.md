RShiny Tutorial Basics

Working through the basics of RShiny from website https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/ 


Beyond the examples given in the tutorial, I have attempted to expand on my own experience with R, as well as my understanding of statistics and machine learning in Python. To do this, I am attempting to develop simple Shiny dashboards that demonstrate my understanding in different contexts. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or corrections to my work so far!
